# DolarBot

- This simple telegram bot retrieves the "blue" values for buy and sell in argentina via the dolarsi API.
- When running main.py, it sends the user a short message with the latest values.
- More functionality can be added by adding more values aside from the "blue", but I deemed it unnecesary for my use case.

There can be many ways to utilize this; I opted to set up a cronjob and periodically run the main.py file.
